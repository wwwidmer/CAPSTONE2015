# Assets.txt

An asset is an image, file, or code that is static and used in a view.
These are images that are uploaded by Programmers ONLY. User uploaded files and images will be served from Media.

An example of an asset is a Javascript file, the base CSS file, or a background image or icon.

If a file is not user uploaded and is not an asset then upload to /static/ (one directory up).
