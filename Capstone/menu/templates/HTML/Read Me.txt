1. <div class="nav nav-tabs"> and <ul class="nav nav-tabs"> 
   will have different effect on font. 
   Expect to use <div>

2. The "Tabs with dropdowns" in nav nav-tabs && "accordion "
   are not working. 
   Both of them have folding effect.
   
3. Using different sources of bootstrap css will have 
   different effect. For instance,
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css"> 
   <link rel="sttlesheet" href="C:\Users\Richard Hung\Desktop\CAPSTONE2015\Capstone\menu\templates\HTML\assets\bootstrap\css\bootstrap.min.css">
